<!-- THE PLAN OF ATTACK:

The outline of any field is given pre-startup.
The tractor drives along a path on the field, the tractor
will log and note this in gpx format and can export this gpx
file to a remote pc that will then transmit that gpx file over TCP
networking software in the form of the gpx (XML) below.

On drone startup it will parse and process the outline once to later detect
out of bounds, it will also process the flight path and then execute for each waypoint
during runtime.
